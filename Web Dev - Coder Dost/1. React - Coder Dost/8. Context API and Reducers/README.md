### useContext, useReducer, Custom Hooks

- **Custom hooks vs Context API**
    - Both appear same, but context api is global, whereas custom hooks are within each component as a local instance
    - custom hooks can be used only in those components where the input and output is used in the same component (eg: usePLaying hook). [Other component states are accessed via parent component]
