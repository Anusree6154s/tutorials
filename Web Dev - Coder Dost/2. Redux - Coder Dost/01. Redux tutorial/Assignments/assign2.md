The code you provided demonstrates the use of the Immer library to handle state mutations in a Redux reducer in a more intuitive and readable way. Immer simplifies the process of updating the state by allowing you to directly modify a draft state within a "producer" function. The library takes care of creating an immutable copy of the state, making it compatible with Redux's principles.

Let's break down the code and explain how Immer is used:

1. **Import Immer:**
   ```javascript
   import { produce } from 'immer';
   ```

   This imports the `produce` function from the Immer library. The `produce` function is used to create a draft of the state and handle modifications within a callback function.

2. **Initial State:**
   ```javascript
   const initialState = {
     amount: 1,
   };
   ```

   The `initialState` object represents the initial state of your Redux store.

3. **Reducer using Immer:**
   ```javascript
   const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
     return produce(state, draftState => {
       switch (action.type) {
         case 'INCREMENT':
           draftState.amount += 1;
           break;

         case 'DECREMENT':
           draftState.amount -= 1;
           break;

         case 'INCREMENT_BY_AMOUNT':
           draftState.amount = draftState.amount + action.value;
           break;

         // Other cases...

         default:
           // No changes
           break;
       }
     });
   };
   ```

   The `produce` function is used within the reducer to create a draft state. Inside the callback function, you can directly modify the `draftState` as if it were mutable. Immer takes care of creating an immutable copy of the state, ensuring that the original state remains unchanged.

4. **Action Creators:**
   ```javascript
   const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
   const decrement = () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
   const incrementByAmount = (value) => ({ type: 'INCREMENT_BY_AMOUNT', value: value });
   ```

   These are example action creators that return action objects with different types.

5. **Usage with Interval:**
   ```javascript
   i = 0
   setInterval(() => {
     while (i < 10) {
       const nextState = reducer(initialState, incrementByAmount(2));
       history.push(nextState)
       console.log(nextState);
       i++
     }
   }, 2000);
   ```

   In this example, a setInterval is used to simulate multiple updates to the state. The `incrementByAmount` action is dispatched within a loop, and the resulting state is logged to the console. The history array is also used to keep track of the state changes.

By using Immer, you can write more straightforward and mutable-looking code within the reducer, while Immer takes care of generating the immutable copies of the state. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
