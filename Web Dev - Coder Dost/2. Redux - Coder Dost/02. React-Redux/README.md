## Chapter 2 - Redux With React Application

- **Assignment 1** : Add more cases in Account Reducer called `decrementByAmount` . Also check that amount should not be decremented in case `amount` to be decremented is less than account Balance. For e.g. if total amount in account is 10, you can't decrement by 11. Also show an error in that situation to user.
 
- **Assignment 2** : Check out IMMER library and run some example and see how you can make mutating updates like `state.amount++` inside reducer logic. And still it work perfectly in redux.
