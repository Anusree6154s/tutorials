Hi, This is course page of **CoderDost Youtube Channel** Redux JS 2023 Course [Video Link ](TODO),

  

### How to use this code :

  

#### You can **download code** in 2 ways :

  

1. **Git Commands**

  

- use `git clone <repository_url>`

  

- checkout 'redux' branch - All Chapters are in same branch but different folders `git checkout redux`

  

- run `npm install` inside the each folder before running the code

  

  

2. If you are not comfortable with git, directly **download the branch as Zip**.

  

- Choose branch related to the Redux e.g. `react`. It contains all chapter

  

- run `npm install` inside each chapter folder before running the code
